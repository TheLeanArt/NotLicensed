This is my first Game Boy project ever. The code is pure assembly and the art is hand-painted.

The demo consists of three separate scenes:

1. "Not licensed by" dropping from above.
2. Â® falling down.
3. Everything flies away.

The 10 sprite-per-scanline limitation is overcome in the third scene by rendering two letters on the background (`e`) and on the window (2nd `n`).

This is my first Game Boy project ever. The code is pure assembly and the art is hand-painted.

The demo consists of three separate scenes:

1. "Not licensed by" dropping from above.
2. Â® falling down.
3. Everything flying away.

## Flavours

* [drop-only](https://github.com/TheLeanArt/NotLicensed/tree/drop-only) (much smaller ROM footprint)
* [music](https://github.com/TheLeanArt/NotLicensed/tree/music) (hUGEDriver integration)

## Technical Details

The 10 sprite-per-scanline limitation is overcome in the third scene by rendering some of the elements separately:

* _by_ and _e_ on the background (causing them to share the vector of movement) and
* 2nd _n_ on the window.

## Building from Source

```
make
```

### Customisations

Make sure that any the following isn't preceded by a comment (`#`).

* **COLOR8:** remove the `#` from `-D COLOR8` in Makefile.
* **EN_GB:** remove the `#` from `-D EN_GB` in Makefile.
